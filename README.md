# Geograppical

Geograppical is a geography app developed primarily as a way for me to learn React. The app doubles as a learning tool for students, and allows them to learn about countries in depth, test their knowledge through a variety of tests, and save their favorite countries and best scores in their personal accounts. The app uses React, React Simple Maps, and Bootstrap for the front-end, and connects to a Google Firestore database.
